<p>The Gairdner edition of the Paston Letters was printed in six volumes.
Each volume is a separate e-text; Volume VI is further divided into two
e-texts, Letters and Index. Volume&nbsp;I, the General Introduction,
will be released after all other volumes, matching the original
publication order.</p>

<p>All brackets are in the original, as are parenthetical question marks
and (<i>sic</i>) notations. Series of dots representing damaged text are
shown as printed. Note that the printed book used <b>z</b> to represent
original yogh <b>ȝ</b>. This has not been changed for the e-text. The
copy number (first page of each volume) is hand-written.</p>

<p>The year of each letter was printed in a sidenote at the top of the
page; this has been merged with the sidenote at the beginning of each
letter. Footnotes have their original numbering, with added page number
to make them usable with the full Index. They are grouped at the end of
each Letter or Abstract.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title ="like this">Text lightly shaded in
violet</ins> indicates the site of a typographical error. Hover the
cursor over the shaded text, and the explanation should appear.
Typographical errors are listed again at the end of the Letter,
after any footnotes. In the primary text, errors were only
corrected if they are clearly editorial, such as missing italics, or
mechanical, such as <span class = "locked">u-for-n</span> misprints.
Italic “d” misprinted as “a” was a recurring problem, especially in
Volume IV. The word “invisible” means that there is an appropriately
sized blank space, but the letter or punctuation mark itself is missing.</p>

<p><i>Some Specifics:</i> The spelling “Jhon” is not an error. Gresham
and Tresham are different people. Conversely, the inconsistent spelling
of the name “Lipyate” or “Lipgate” in footnotes is unchanged. In
Volume&nbsp;IV, the spelling “apostyle” for “apostille” is used
consistently.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 232.] This letter is ascribed by Fenn to the year 1465,
in consequence of the allusion to John Paston’s imprisonment in the
Fleet. But there were more occasions than one on which he was confined
there. Fenn himself knew of two. Paston was committed to the Fleet, as
we know from William Worcester, on Saturday, the 3rd November 1464. He
was also confined there in August and September 1465, and may very
possibly have been released by the beginning of November. But I am
inclined to think this letter refers to an imprisonment prior to either
of these. For, in the first place, the news of it seems only to have
been recent. It had become general subject of conversation at Norwich,
‘on Saturday last,’ whereas in 1465 it must have been known two months
earlier. Secondly, Sir William Chamberlain, whose influence Sir Thomas
Howes hopes will be of service, must have died in the spring of 1462.
According to Blomefield (<i>Hist. of Norfolk</i>, i. 321), his will was
dated the 3rd March 1461 (which would be in the modern computation
1462), and was proved on the 21st April 1462. It may be presumed,
therefore, that on receiving the letter from his brother Clement (No.&nbsp;484), written on the 11th October 1461,
John Paston hastened up to London and was immediately thrown into
prison. By this letter, however, we find that he was soon afterwards
released, and his great enemy Howard sent to prison in his stead.</p>

for convenience. The two are evidently some years apart in point of
date, and nothing is quite clear about the date of either, except that
the latter must have been written in the reign of Edward <span class =

will not give a noble, nor even 6 shillings, for a cow. Dey occupies
your lands there till you come home. Risynge would take them and the
closes at Castre if he is not to have Calcotte. The prests shall be paid
as soon as we get money, I&nbsp;hope this week. Wheat 12<i>d.</i> a
comb, barley 8<i>d.</i>, malt 9<i>d.</i> and 10<i>d.</i> No good price
for malt, ‘saving, as we understand, it is good Flanders.’ John Russe

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The mention
of Tuddenham and Heyden in this letter proves that it cannot be of later
date than the year 1461, as the former was executed in February 1462. At
the same time the reference to John Paston, Junior, could not be much
earlier, and the message from the King to the people of Norfolk
certainly could not have come from Henry <span class =

therefore be 1461 precisely.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The manor of
Burneviles in Nacton, near Ipswich, was part of the lands of Sir John
Fastolf which Paston inherited by his will; but his claim was disputed
by Jenney, one of the executors. As Jenney is here said to have
complained that his fee was two years in arrear, we may presume that it
was little over two years since Fastolf’s death when this letter was
written. For further evidences of date compare <a href =
"#letter494">No. 494</a>. It may also be observed that we find undoubted
evidence that John Paston was residing in the Inner Temple six weeks
later (<i>see</i> <a href = "#letter511">No. 511</a>), whereas in the
preceding year he was in Norfolk, where his brother Clement wrote to him

however, cannot be 1461, as William Paston was in London that year as
early as the 4th April. It seems also from this letter that John Paston
had recently left home, which could not have been the case in 1461 if

little doubt that the true date is 1462, and that the substance of the

[From Fenn, i. 260.] This letter must have been written in the year 1462
before the Duke of Somerset was received into favour. Proclamations
similar to those mentioned in this letter were issued on the 6th March
1461 and the 11th May 1464; but neither of these can be the case
referred to. The coming of the King to London must have been in the
beginning of September 1462. He was in London on the 14th of that month,
and had been at Fotheringay on the 1st, as the dates of Privy Seals
inform us.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 266.] In the month of October 1462, as we learn from
William Worcester, Margaret of Anjou came out of France, whither she had
fled in spring, with a force of 2000 men, landed on the coast of
Northumberland, and laid siege to Bamborough, which she took and placed
in the keeping of the Duke of Somerset.</p>

<span class = "firstword">That</span> it please my lordis good grase to
be good lord and supporter of Paston in his right and possession of the
maner till his right can be lawfully or be trete dispreved by his
adversaries, consideryng that the said Paston is my lordis homager and
was nevir ayens his lordship and that my lord is not gretly behold to do
for the seid Pastons adversaries as he understandith.</p>

<p>And in case my lord woll not supporte the seid Paston in his right
but be indifferent athwyx bothe parties, that thanne it please my lorde
to have consideracion to the right of the mater as folowyth in articles
and ther upon to be remembird whedir it be resonably desired by William
Jenney or by Debenham as his waged man or for his sake that Paston shuld
leve the possession or the takyng of the profitez of the seid maner.</p>

<p>First to be remembird that the seid maner aswell as the maner of
Nakton were Sir John Fastolffis, and that the seid Paston of the seid
maners toke estatis at Cotton and attornement of the tenauntis viij. or
ix. yere goo, in such wise as the tenauntes can reporte, and continued
there in possession aswell in the live of the seid Sir John as sithen,
and hath take the profitez therof sith the discese of the said Fastolff,
except for the terme of Mighelmes a yere passed, whech tyme the
tenauntes were compellid by fors of distresses to pay ayens ther willes
part of the seid profitez.</p>

<p>And that also the title of the seid Paston to the seid maner is not
all only by the seid feffement but aswell by a graunt and bargeyn made a
thwyx the seid Fastolff and the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page63" id = "page63">63</a></span>
seid Paston as by the last will of the seid Fastolff, where by the seid
Paston ought to take the hole profitez of the seid maner, and also it is
lefull to the seid Paston to kepe the seid maner with fors, consideryng
he hath be in possession iij. yere and more; hough be it, the seid
Paston intendyth to kepe the seid maner pesibly and non otherwise. And
that the pretense and cleyme of the seid Jenney is that he schuld be
infeffed with the seid Paston in the seid maner; by whech pretense, if
it were trewe, yet the seid Paston by reason shuld not be put out of the
seid maner, for who som evir had titell therto by feffement or by
executrie, Paston shuld be on that had title; hough be it, the seid
Paston cleymyth not in that forme, but by the titell of his bargeyne and
by the seid Fastolffis will.</p>

<p>Item, to be remembird, whech tyme as my lord had wretyn his lettirs
and sent his servauntes for the eyde and supporte of the seid Paston to
take the profitez of the seid maner of Nakton as of the maner of Cotton,
desyryng the tenauntes to the seid Paston, the seid Jenney wold have no
consideracion therto; hough be it, though he were a feffe he had no
titell to take the seid profitez, consideryng he is non executor, but
presumptuously, havyng no consideracion to my lordis lettir ner sendyng,
compellid the tenauntis by distresses to pay hym more besely thanne any
feffe or executor, and now at this same tyme hath be at Nakton and
reseyvid as moch mony as he coud gader there.</p>

<p>Item, where at Mighelmesse the yere passed the seid Paston sent his
sone, a&nbsp;servaunt of my Lordis, and also Richard Calle, servaunt to
the seid Paston put to hym by my Lordis fader,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag63_1" id = "tag63_1" href = "#note63_1">63.1</a> to reseyve the
profitez of the seid maner as thei had do many yeres before, the seid
Jenney ded arest the seid Calle for a thef and as a thef caried hym to
th’entent that the tenauntes shuld be discoraged to pay the seid Paston.
Whech tyme, at the request of the said Calles kynred, it pleased my lord
to write to the seid Jenney and Debenham
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page64" id = "page64">64</a></span>
for the deliverauns of the seid Calle; to which letteris they nouther
toke hede nor reputation, but by that sotilte reseyved the profitez of
the seid maner, the seid Paston havyng non help by my seid Lordis
writyng nor sendyng.</p>

<p>Wherfore please my Lordis good lordship to supporte the seid Paston
in kepyng of his right and possession till it be dispreved or knowe
onlawfull, and the seid Paston will applye to such meanes as it pleasith
my Lord to take wherby the right of the mater may be undirstond and
determined.</p>

<p>And also that it like my lord to remembir that it is not behofefull
for any prinse lightly to geve trust or to applye to the desires of any
persones that have geve hym cause of mistrust.</p>

petition must have been drawn up at the end of 1462 or in the beginning
of 1463, which would be considered still 1462 in the old computation. It
must have been fully three years after Fastolf’s death, which took place
on the 5th November 1459, and the imprisonment of Richard Calle in 1461
(<i>see</i> No.&nbsp;487) is referred to as
having taken place ‘at Michaelmas the year past.’ The nobleman to whom

Paston’s hand, and there can be no doubt to whom it was addressed. As to
the year in which it was written there is no positive evidence; but
Daubeney and Calle were both with Margaret Paston in the beginning of
1463 (<i>see</i> <a href = "#letter536">No. 536</a>), and the only thing
against that date is that Margaret, writing to her husband (then in
London) on the 19th, acknowledges only a letter of the 9th. This,
however, might well be owing to the disturbed state of the country, or

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter,
though not addressed, seems to have been written by Margaret Paston to
her husband. The election referred to must have been that for the
Parliament of 1463. From one expression used it is clear that it was
written some time before Easter, and the dispute with Jenney and
Debenham about Calcote proves the date to a certainty. Compare <a href =

‘Yelverton,’ is very ambiguous from the careless writing.</p>

<p>Remember my instructions about bills and actions against Debenham by
my tenants at Calcote. Make a ‘remembrance apart’ of the ground on which
every trespass has been committed, whether it be in my lands or in those
of my tenants, and whether the land was holden of me by Calcote Hall
fee, or Freton Hall fee, lest Debenham justify [on the plea that] he
took them elsewhere. As my tenants at Cotton have been compelled to pay
much money to Jenney and Debenham against their wills, I&nbsp;would, as
I have told John Paston the younger, that he should ride to Cotton with
Richard Calle and such friendship as he can get, and demand my duties,
except from those who had been compelled to pay the others. The latter
to take actions next term against Debenham. Will respite them for this
once all they have paid, till it may be recovered by law;

tenants and when he comes to Cotton enter therein how much cattle has
been distrained from each.</p>

<p class = "annotation">
It appears by the last letter that a writ was issued, evidently at the
suit of Debenham, against John Paston, junior, and the other agents of
his father in Suffolk. From the present paper it would seem that John
Paston also instituted a prosecution on behalf of his tenants against
Debenham. We shall find by later letters that these suits were going on
in 1463, and were not terminated in the beginning of the following year.

Testimony of Sir Roger Chamberlain, witnessed by Reginald Tylneye, prior
of Ixworth, and Sir John Rose [a&nbsp;brother of the house], that he was
with the Duke of Norfolk in September before Sir John Fastolf died, when
my Lord urged Fastolf to sell him the reversion of Caister, or
(as&nbsp;he wished to give it to the Abbey of St. Benet’s) to exchange
it for a manor of my Lord’s in South Walsham, which lay more convenient
for the Abbey. Sir John, however, begged him not to press it, as he had
appointed with his cousin, John
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page74" id = "page74">74</a></span>
Paston, to have Caister and all his other livelode in Norfolk and
Suffolk in order to endow a college of seven priests and seven poor men.
My Lord said, many thought Sir John would make Paston his heir; to which
he replied that there was no man living that he would like better to be
his heir, and begged my Lord to be his good lord if it so fortuned,
which the Duke promised to do. Has heard the Duke since often
acknowledge that Sir John had declared plainly he would make Paston his
heir. Not having his own seal present, has sealed this with that of the
prior of Ixworth, and requested him to put his seal to it besides.
Ixworth, 6&nbsp;April 1463.</p>

This looks like a mistake, for no Speaker of the name of Fynes is met
with during this period. The expression, however, suggests that the
letter was written about the beginning of a new Parliament, which could
only have been that which met on the 29th April 1463. On the following
day the Commons elected John Say as their Speaker, whose name Margaret
Paston seems to have confounded with the family name of William Fenys,
Lord Say, the trusty friend of Edward <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span> who accompanied him into exile when he fled from
his kingdom in 1470. It does not appear, however, that John Say, the
Speaker, was related to that family.</p>

that I supposed that my maistres, your wyf, had not be remembred of the

it is not gretely to be comuned of with other, nor to comune of casez

elapsed since a murder committed on the morrow of St. Peter’s Day

to sit some little time after Relic Sunday, which always falls in the

[From Fenn, iv. 250.] John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, the writer of this
letter, succeeded his father in the dukedom in November 1461, being at
the time only seventeen years of age. A&nbsp;year afterwards, in
November 1462, we find him living at his castle of Holt in Denbighshire,
where he proposed to spend Christmas (<i>see</i> <a href =
"#letter532">No. 532</a>), but before that season came he was sent for
by the King to serve against the Scots (<a href =

was written in the August of 1463; for although the Duke was again
living at Holt in March following, it seems probable that he would have
visited his chief family seat at Framlingham in the meanwhile. John
Paston, the youngest, who was attached to his household, was certainly
at home with his family in the latter part of this year (<i>see</i>

[From Fenn, iv. 88.] I have found no letters of Margaret Paston dated
from Caister before the year 1463; but I am inclined to think that this
and the letter following both belong to that year. The latter, being
addressed to Sir John Paston, at least cannot be earlier, and my reasons
for believing it to be of that very year will be seen in the note to it
(<a href = "#note84_2">p.&nbsp;84, Note&nbsp;2</a>). It is just possible
that this letter may be of a different date, but considering that both
were written in November, and both of them certainly between the 12th
and the 19th, and that in both Margaret Paston not only dates from
Caister, but speaks of Daubeney as being with her, the presumption,
I&nbsp;think, is pretty strong that they are of the same year.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 168.] As Sir John Paston was knighted in the year 1463,
and his father died in May 1466, the date of this letter must lie
between the years 1463 and 1465. I&nbsp;think the first of these years
is probably the true date. Sir John Paston, it seems, had left home
without letting his mother know of his intention. Whither had he gone?
Not to London, because he addressed a letter to his father there;
besides he had passed by Lynn. One would naturally suppose, therefore,
that he had gone to wait upon the King, at a time when Edward was at a
distance from the capital. And in this view we are confirmed by the
passage in which Margaret desires her son to speak with Wykes, who, as
we know by <a href = "#letter514">Letter 514</a>, was an usher of the
King’s Chamber. Now Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span> was in
Yorkshire, staying, for the most part, at Pomfret, during October and
November 1463, while about the same time of year in 1464 he was at
Reading, and in 1465 at Greenwich. Sir John would naturally have passed
through Lynn on his road to the North.</p>

[From Fenn, i. 278.] By the mention of Sir John Paston it is evident
that this letter was written after 1463, but of course the date cannot
be later than 1466, in which year John Paston the father died, to whom
the letter is addressed. It appears also to have been written shortly
after the death of James Sevenoke, Abbot of St. Augustine’s, Canterbury,
which Fenn, I&nbsp;know not on what authority, says occurred in 1463.
Even the new edition of Dugdale does not give the date; but Fenn’s date
is in all probability right.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 72.] This letter and the next both mention assizes at
Thetford. The latter, which is dated on Wednesday, the last (29th) day
of February, and which was certainly written in the year 1464, mention
them as being held on that very day. The present letter, dated on the
second Monday in Lent, says they are <i>to be</i> held on Wednesday
following. Now the second Monday in Lent 1464 fell on the 27th of
February, that is to say just two days before that particular Wednesday
on which we know that the assizes really were held. This alone seems
almost sufficient evidence of the date of the letter. As for the King’s
going up to London, it appears by the dates of the Privy Seals that on
the 9th February he was at Gloucester, on the 16th and 17th at
Kimbolton; and it is stated in the next letter that he was at Waltham on
the 27th, which shows that he really was moving towards the capital.
This was not the case in 1462, the year to which Fenn assigns the
letter; nor do I know his authority for stating that there was a
Burgundian Embassy in the beginning of that year.</p>

falling on a Wednesday fixes the date of this letter to the year 1464.
There is no evidence in the dates of Privy Seals that the King was at
Waltham in the end of February, or that he had previously visited
Cambridgeshire, in any year during the period when this letter must have
been written; but it is quite possible that he was at Waltham on the
27th February 1464, and if so, that he had passed through Cambridgeshire

[From Fenn, i. 284.] ‘The Duke of Somerset’s going’ here referred to
cannot well be his flight to Scotland in 1462 (<i>see</i> <a href =
"#letter512">No. 512</a>), though the time of year at which this letter
is dated would agree very well with that supposition; for it appears by
<a href = "#letter511">Letter 511</a> that John Paston, the father, was
at that time residing in the Temple and not at Caister; nor indeed have
we distinct evidence of his being at the latter place before 1464.
Moreover, in the beginning of 1463, Somerset had just made his peace
with King Edward and been received into favour, but early in 1464 he
rebelled again. There can be little doubt, therefore, that this year is
the true date.</p>

<p>1. John Davy chaplain, staying at the University of Cambridge,
<i>liberæ conditionis</i>, 30 years old and more, examined <i>super
exceptionibus infrascriptis</i> of which the tenors are quoted, viz., on
the part of Yelverton and Worceter against John Russe, Robert Cutteler
clk., Master Clement Felmyngham, Rob. Boteler, Ralph Lampet, Brother
Will. Bokyngham, and Master Robert Popy, witnesses on the opposite side,
whose testimony is discredited ‘eo quod parte sua non præsenti
juraverunt et super non juratis deposuerunt, ac in depositionibus suis
fuerint et sint varii, contrarii, singulares negativam asserentes,
causas dictorum suorum minime reddentes, unumque et eundem præmeditatum
sermonem proferentes, a&nbsp;testatore non vocati aut rogati perhibere
testimonium, nec sufficienter probantes in hac parte, prout ex
inspectione depositionum suarum liquere poterit intuenti.’ Further, John
Russe was illiterate, and did not understand Latin when he made his
deposition, and he contradicted the other witnesses on his own side:
viz., to the 9th interrogatory he said, Sir J.&nbsp;Fastolf’s will was
not written before his death, which Clement Felmyngham and Robt.
Cutteler in their reply to the 3d said it was. Moreover he expected
advantage to himself from his testimony, and was discharged by Howys of
£300 that he owed Fastolf. He had also secretly abstracted certain
muniments and charters of the testator, which were in the custody of
Will. Worceter, in the house of John Tovy, at Castir, Norwich dioc., in
Nov. 1459. Moreover he was <i>supravisor et locator</i> of the
testator’s lands called Akethorpe, yearly value 9 marks, appointed by
Paston or Howys, who promised to sell them to him much under value for
his testimony. Further, his statement that he was present <i>in quadam
bassa camera</i> at Caister between 8 and 9 <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span> on the Saturday before Sir J.&nbsp;Fastolf’s
death, was a perjury, for he was really all that time in other places a
long way off. His declaration that he was no servant or tenant of those
who brought him forward was untrue: he had hired a house of Howys in the
town of Yarmouth, value 40s. a&nbsp;year. He was inconsistent in his
testimony about the hour Sir J. declared his will. He also pretended
never to have seen Fastolf’s will before his death, although he wrote
the said pretended will with his own hand with the date at the head,
which at the beginning of this suit he caused to be cut off from the
writing and hidden.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page103" id = "page103">103</a></span>
<p>Also the said Rob. Cutteler chaplain, when he made his deposition,
was ‘levis opinionis, malæ conscientiæ et de mensa Joh’is Paston ac
tenens ipsius, prout ad primum interrogatorium examinationis suæ primæ
et secundæ respondebat.’ Also he was perjured; because in April 1457 in
par. of Holy Trin., Castir, he beat and maimed one Jo. Flemyng, and
boasted of it (<i>ac&nbsp;sic factum nomine suo ratum habuit</i>), but
being taken before Sir J.&nbsp;Fastolf, justice of the peace, he swore
he had not done so.&mdash;Proofs that he was not disinterested.</p>

<p>Exceptions to Rob. Popy: He was a tenant of Paston’s, &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Davy</i> says John Rus was at Yarmouth on the Saturday in
question, as he usually was on Saturdays, to buy victuals for Fastolf’s
house, &amp;c. (Proof declared insufficient in the margin). Sir
J.&nbsp;Fastolf was so ill, that, as Davy had heard he was unable to
speak from 22d Oct. ‘Quæ quidem infirmitas vocabatur judicio medicorum,
<i>sincope</i>, quæ ipsum vexabat singulis horis et ipsum deduxit ad
extasim de scientia istius jurati, qui continue conversabatur cum eo
usque ad ipsius mortem.’</p>

<p>2. Thos. Upton, one of the clerks of the King’s kitchen,
<i>literatus</i>, ‘liberæ conditionis,’ forty years old and over; 2d.
witness.</p>

<p>Mentions that W. Worceter gave Jo. Rus a casket to keep containing
certain documents, which Rus delivered to Howys after Fastolf’s death.
Was clerk of the kitchen to Fastolf when Rus used to go on Saturday to
Yarmouth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>9 May. Jo. Bokkyng produced by Jo. Naseby, proctor of Yelverton and
Worceter, before Master Tho. Wynterton, LL.D., auditor of Thomas
Archbishop of Canterbury, at his house in the parish of St. Martin, in
presence of Robert Kent, proctor of John Paston.&mdash;Examination
committed to John Druell, LL.D. who on the 12th May examines him
secretly in the house of the treasurer of St. Paul’s.</p>

<p>‘Dicit quod Johannes Tovy quædam munimenta et evidencias<a class =
"tag" name = "tag103_1" id = "tag103_1" href = "#note103_1">103.1</a> in
certis bagis et pixidibus contenta quæ Willelmus Worceter eidem Johanni
Tovy liberavit custodienda.’ Rus was and is Howys’ tenant for the house
he lives in. After Fastolf’s death Upton delivered to Clement Felmyngham
a signet or gold ring, ‘ad signandum sigilla dicti domini Johannis
Fastolf,’ in a little bag, which was to be returned ‘post signacionem
hujusmodi,’ but afterwards he said he had lost it. Touchyng brother
W.&nbsp;Bukyngham, it was publicly noised at Yarmouth that Robert Brown,
a&nbsp;chaplain of that town, had killed one Seman Burton, that
Bukyngham knowingly received him, and that by his advice he fled. To the
last exception he says he believes Fastolf did not release Paston from
the payment of the said 4000 marks, ‘quia iste juratus non intellixit in
tota vita sua tantam liberalitatem in dicto domino Johanne Fastolf.’
Fastolf had such difficulty in breathing for five or six days before his
death that he could hardly speak.</p>

<p class = "space">
Interrogatories proposed on the part of Paston and Howys, and
administered to witnesses.</p>

<p>‘In primis, interrogetur quilibet testis hujusmodi cujus sit

numbered.</p>

<p>Then follow answers of some one, whose name does not appear, to each
of these six interrogatories; and other answers by&mdash;</p>

Norfolk.</p>

<p>2. John Loer, servant of the Abbot of Langley.</p>

<p>3. Will. Eton.</p>

<p>4. Rob. Lynne of Bucklande.</p>

<p>5. Barth. Elys of Yarmouth, ‘literatus liberæ conditionis,’ fifty
years old and more (proves Rus’s absence, but his testimony is declared
in the margin to be improbable, and not to agree with Davy’s).</p>

<p><i>6 July.</i> Naseby produces Rob. Wylly on the part of Yelverton
and Worcester. Examined on the 9th.&mdash;Says he was required by Paston
and Howys to see Fastolf’s will, and ‘ad impediendum
[<i>impendendum</i>] consilium suum:’&mdash;that on a Sunday in the
summer after Fastolf’s death, John Paston showed him, at Fastolf’s house
in Southwark, Sir John’s will written on paper, in presence of Clement
Felmyngham and John Bracley, and asked his opinion if it was valid.
Thought it insufficient to overthrow any previous will. A&nbsp;clause
mentioning Tudenham and Heydon as executors was cancelled by this
deponent’s advice, ‘eo quod erat contra caritatem.’</p>

<p><i>13 July at Bow Church.</i> Naseby produces John Marshall and John
Davy, whose examinations follow.</p>

<p><i>19 Oct. 1464.</i> Druell examines Hen. Wenstall at the treasurer’s
house of St. Paul’s.</p>

<p><i>15 Nov. 1464.</i> Druell examines Rob. Hert.</p>

<p><i>1 Dec.</i> Naseby produces Rob. Fyztrauf, whose production Kent
opposes; who tries to prove Rus’s absence (insufficiently, as remarked
in the margin), because he was constantly with Fastolf, except half an
hour that morning, and held the basin while Henry Barbour lathered the
beard (<i>lavit barbam</i>) of the said Sir John Fastolf.</p>

<p>‘Responsiones personaliter factæ per dominum Thomam Howys unum
executorum domini Joh’is Fastolf, ultimo die mensis Aprilis Aº
D<sup>ni</sup> 1464,’ &amp;c., ‘coram Ven. viro Mag’ro Thoma
Wynterbourne, LL.D.,’ &amp;c., ‘in camera ejusdem infra manerium
Rev<sup>mi</sup> patris apud Lamehith, Winton dioc’ situat’, in
præsenncia mei Nicholai Parker,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Howys says he did not see Coteler or Rus in Fastolf’s chamber that
Saturday before he went to dinner. On Saturday and Sunday before his
death Fastolf spoke so low he could hardly be heard by any one, and
Howys heard him only by putting his ear close to his mouth. Fastolf’s
mind was clear.</p>

depositions, of which we shall only attempt to give some of the

mentioned in this letter seems to have reference to a proclamation dated
the 11th May 1464, by which all men between the ages of sixty and
sixteen were ordered to attend the King. The date is confirmed by the
reference in the postscript to the death of ‘Rous of Suffolk,’ for

[From Fenn, iii. 418.] It is difficult to assign with confidence either
a date or a meaning to this strangely worded epistle. The signature
itself is a mystery. The order of the Temple of Sion is unknown to
archæologists, and the place from which the letter is dated cannot be
identified. From the peculiar device used as a signature, resembling
what in heraldry represents a fountain, Fenn threw out a suggestion that
Fountaine was the writer’s name, remarking that a family of that name
resided at Salle, in Norfolk, and might have been related to Paston as
the writer claimed to be. But there seems to be an air of irony about
the whole communication which forbids us to construe any of its
statements seriously; nor do we find the slightest allusion to this
letter or its contents in all the rest of the correspondence. For my
part, I&nbsp;am inclined to think it was a mocking letter addressed to
John Paston by one of the prisoners in the Fleet, where Paston had
himself been confined in 1464. His imprisonment on that occasion was
probably of short duration, but I cannot tell the precise date of his
release. He was committed to the Fleet, as we are informed by William
Worcester (<i>Itinerary</i>, p. 366), on Saturday the 3d November. If I
am right in my conjecture about this letter, he had, perhaps, been
already liberated; but some of his late fellow-prisoners, probably
members of the Inner or Middle Temple like himself, who had formed
themselves into a fancy ‘Order of the Temple of Sion,’ amused themselves
by speculating on the probability that he was not yet quite clear of the
toils of the law, and that he would be obliged to come back and spend
Christmas in gaol, among the jolly companions whom he had recently
deserted. I&nbsp;may remark that the name of Thomas Babington occurs in
Dugdale’s <i>Origines Juridiciales</i>, p. 163, as having been elected a
reader in the Inner Temple in 22 Hen. <span class =
"smallroman">VII.</span>, when he seems to have been an old man; for,
owing to his sight failing, he was excused from reading, and John Port,
who was afterwards Attorney General, and, later still, Justice of the
King’s Bench, read in his place.</p>

Constantine Dalby had been rector of Mautby from 1453 to 1460, and

1458. He was succeeded at Mautby by Thomas Howes from 1460 to 1465, and
then by Robert Cutler or Cotteler, who must be the ‘parson of Mautby’

[From Fenn, iv. 134.] This letter must be later than the year 1463, as
Sir John Paston does not appear to have been knighted so early as
February in that year. But as John Paston, the father, was at Caister
and not at London in the early part of the year 1464, it cannot be that
year. Neither can we assign it to 1466, the last year of John Paston’s
life, as it appears by a letter written on the 17th February in that
year that although John Paston was in London, his son Sir John could not
have been there for some time before. We are therefore shut up to the
year 1465 as the only possible date for this letter.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The claims
laid by the Duke of Suffolk to Drayton and Hellesden occupy a prominent
place in this correspondence during the year 1465, and I do not find
them alluded to in any letter of an earlier date. Moreover, the purchase
by virtue of which the Duke laid claim to the latter manor, which is
reported here as a secret, is mentioned again as a piece of news in a
letter undoubtedly written on the 10th May 1465. There can be little
doubt therefore that this letter is of the same year. The apostyle, or

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] Holy Rood
Day, on which this letter is dated, commonly means the 14th of September
(feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross). Here I suspect it is the
3rd May (Invention of the Holy Cross), as the contents of the letter
suit that date in the year 1465. It will be seen that Margaret Paston
dates from Caister, and proposes next week to be at Hellesden. Her next
letter, dated the 10th May, is from Hellesden, and shows that she
carried out the intention here expressed of sending men to collect money
at Drayton, and had left her eldest son at Caister to keep the place.
There is also a close agreement between that letter and this, in what is
said about the demeanour of the tenants and Mr. Philip’s conduct. The
apostyle of this letter, as of the preceding, is in the hand of John
Paston, very ill written, and occasionally ambiguous.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] The date of
this letter is rendered certain by the mention of Thomas Ellis as having
been elected Mayor of Norwich. He was so elected for the second time in
1465. He had been Mayor before in 1460-61, and was again after this in
1474-75; but neither of these latter dates will suit the other contents
of this letter. Like some others of this year, this letter is apostyled
by John Paston.</p>

Thomas Hert, perhaps a relation of the Bishop of Norwich, was presented
to the rectory of Hellesden by Sir John Fastolf in 1448, but how long he
held it is uncertain, as the list of rectors is very defective, and the
next name that appears on it is George Gardiner in 1579.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 164.] There can be little doubt this letter was written
in the year 1465, when Margaret was troubled by Mr. Philip Lipgate and
the Duke of Suffolk’s bailiff of Cossey. It may be observed also that
Margaret here dates from Hellesden, and speaks of having been recently
at Caister. Compare <a href = "#letter579">Nos. 579</a> and <a href =
"#letter581">581</a>. Further, the name of John Jenney is found on the
Commission of the Peace for Norfolk, dated the 1st April 1465 (Patent,
5&nbsp;Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>, p. 1, m.&nbsp;32),
but it is not on the commission issued on the 20th February following
(<i>ib.</i>, m.&nbsp;27); so that John Paston seems to have acted on his
wife’s suggestion and been successful in getting him removed.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
is not addressed on the back, nor is the handwriting that of Margaret
Paston, but from the subscription it would appear to have been written
by her to one of her sons; and as John Paston the younger is mentioned
in the body of the letter, the person addressed was evidently his elder
brother. The letter seems to have been written shortly before the Duke
of Suffolk’s attempt on Hellesden mentioned in the next No., probably on
the Saturday preceding it.</p>

to have entred, notwithstandyng they seyde they come not for to entre;
but withoute dought, and they had been strong inough for us, they wolde

John Salett and Master John Bulleman for to trete, and so they ded; and
the Duc men seide they had a warant for to attache John Dawbeney, Wyks,
Calle, Hunewrthe, and Bliclyng and other, weche they wuld have; and my
master, Sir John, answerd them, and seide that they were not withine,
and though we had ben, they shuld not have had hem; and so they desired
oon of our men. And so
<span class = "pagenum">

Naunton stede by my mastres and haxed hem whom they wold have, and seyde
if they wold have hem he wold go with hem, and so he ded. And on the
next day they caryed hym forthe to my Lord of Suffolk to Claxton,
through Norwich; and ther we had founde a remedy for hym for to heve
lette hym; and he wold not, but nedys go forthe with hem; but like a
jentelman he was entreated amongs hem. And Harleston desyred at
Heylesdon to speke with my mastre, Sir John, and so he ded, and seyde to
hym it were ryght weele don that he rode to my Lord of Suffolk and
desired hym in any wice that he schulde do so, and seyde that it was hes
dwte so for to do, in asmoche as my Lorde was come to contre, and that
he wolde ryde with hym, and brynge hym to my Lorde; and he answerd and
seide to hym, whan that he undrestode that my Lord were hes fathers
goode Lord and hes, that thanne he wolde se hes Lordship, and [ell]es he
had non aronde to hym; and so they departed. And thanne appoyntement was
taken that they shull sende home ther men, and we schuld send home oure.

<p>As for that it is desyrid I shuld show my tytill and evydens to the

marchants of London callid Jon Heylisdon longe er any of the Polis that
the seyd Dewk comyth of wer borne to any lond in Norfolk or Suffolk; and
if they wer at that tyme born to no lond, how may the seyd Dewk klaym
Drayton be that pedegre? As for the seyd John Heylisdon, he was a por
man born, and from hym the seyd maner dessended to Alice his dowtyr, hos
estat I have, and I soppose the seyd Dewk comyth not of hem.</p>

<p>Item, as for the pedegre of the seyd Dewk, he is sone to William
Pool, Dewk of Suffolk, sone to Mychell Pool, Erl of Suffolk, sone to
Mychel Pool, the furst Erl of Suffolk of the Polis, mad be King Richard
seth my fader was born; and the seyd furst Mychell was sone to on
William Pool of Hull, whech was a wurchepfull man grow be fortwne of the
werld. And he was furst a marchant, and after a knygth, and after he was
mad baneret; and if any of thees hadde the maner of Drayton I will los
C<i>li.</i> so that any persone for the Dewk will be bond in as moch to
prove the contrary; and I wot weel the seyd Dewkis Cowncell wil not
claym the seyd maner be the tytill of the fader of the seyd William
Pool. And what the fader of the seyd William was, as be the pedegre mad
in the seyd last Dewkis fadirs daijs I know rygt weell; wherof I
informyd Herry Boteler to tell my old Lady of Suffolk, becawse he is of
her cowncell; and more will I not tell in thes mater, but if
[<i>unless</i>] I&nbsp;be desyrid or compellid.</p>

<p>Item, let my Lord of Norwich wete that it is not profitabe ner the
comen well of gentilmen that any jentilman shuld be compellid be an
entre of a lord to shew his evidens or tytill to his lond, ner I wil not

hand like that of James Gresham. It is anonymous and without address.
Even the writer is very uncertain. But it may not unlikely be a draft
letter from Margaret Paston to some neighbour who, while the Duke of
Suffolk was laying claim to Hellesden and Drayton, was not too mindful
of John Paston’s rights. Brandeston is about eleven miles from Norwich,
eight miles beyond Drayton. Thomas Hoop was parson of Brandeston from
1448 to 1475. He was presented to the living by Sir John Fastolf.</p>

John Russe woll telle yow what he hath reseyvid for hand bifore this

grauntyd hym the maner of Akthorp in Leystoft, at a certeyn prise, as it
apperyd by writyng undir my seall, and desired me that I wold take the
seid somme in party of payment. And I told hym that as for such mony
that shuld com from hym for that lond, I&nbsp;wold take it of hym and
ley it up by the self, that I myght purchase other lond therwith,
bicause I wold lesse Fastolffs lyvelode for the college, but I wold pay

that same xj<i>li.</i>, and ley it up to the same use, seying to me that
it was as good to do so as I for to take it hym, and he to take it me
ayen. And thus he and I agreed, and departed, and thanne he prayd me to
take more chafar of hym, whech I denyed. And nough I merveyll what shuld
cause hym to aske mony for that dewte; neverthelesse I deme he supposith
that he coud not opteyne his bargeyn by me, bicause of the trobill that
it standyth in; and for that or for some other cause he repentyth his
bargeyn and woll nomore of it. Wherfore send for hym, and take James
Gresham or some of your frends and Richard Calle, and fele what he
menyth; and if ye can fynd hym disposed to leve his bargeyn yet, though
I myght kepe stille the seid mony I wold he shuld

<p>Also the seid John Russe writyth in his lettir that rather thanne he
shuld fayle this mony that I wold lend hym asmoch to pay ayen at

[From Fenn, iii. 370.] That this letter was written in the year 1465
appears clearly by the reference to the Assizes held at Walsingham
(<i>see</i> <a href = "#letter599">No. 599</a>), and the intention which
the writer intimates of visiting her husband in London. Moreover, the
first sentence of the letter, and also the postscript, are evidently
written in answer to her husband’s complaint in <a href =
"#letter600">No. 600</a>, that she had not written to him what she had
done at the Assizes.</p>

In the Introduction in Volume <span class = "smallroman">I.</span>, will
be found a document entitled ‘A&nbsp;remembrance of the worshipful kin
and ancestry of Paston, born in Paston in Gemyngham Soken.’ This paper,
which was printed in the preface to vol. v. of the original edition, p.
xliv., appears to have been composed during the lifetime of John Paston
by some one who owed the family no good will, not unlikely by Sir
William Yelverton. The contents agree very well with the imputation made
on John Paston, for which he was imprisoned in 1465, that he was a
bondman to the King. The original of this document I have not met

William Yelverton, Knight, and William Worcester, pretensed executors of
Sir John Fastolf, and John Paston, Esq., and Thomas Howys, executors, as
is said, dated 8 July 1465.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page182" id = "page182">182</a></span>
<p>1. Whether Sir John Fastolf made his will, dated 14 June 1459, in
English, and sealed by him with his seal of arms? Answer. He made a note
of articles in his will, deponent thinks in Latin, probably on that day,
but it was not then sealed, and no executor was named.</p>

<p>2. Whether before the will was fair copied an original note of it was
made on paper, and corrected and interlined by Paston? And whether that
note fair copied was the true will which was sealed by
Fastolf?&mdash;There was such a note, which being made, Paston went to
London and waited some time, when William Worcester informed him it had
been fair copied in the beginning of July. Had seen an old will long
before, in which some of the articles were the same, but Fastolf altered
them from time to time in consultations held with this deponent. Does
not know if he did interline, but the note will show, which was then in
the keeping of William Worcester, Fastolf’s clerk; nor does he know if
the will was drawn up from it, as he was not present at the engrossing
or sealing, but hears there were several things altered.</p>

<p>3. Where the will is, in whose custody, and whether he have power to
execute it?&mdash;The parchment sealed by Fastolf, which Worcester says
was his will, was kept some time after his death at Caister, and
afterwards produced in audience of the Archbishop, and there
remains.</p>

<p>28 Aug. Examined in the Fleet.&mdash;Said he was a prisoner, wished
first to speak with his counsel, and desired another notary joined with
Nicholas Parker, who was not indifferent.</p>

<p>10, 11, 12 Dec. Appeared before the commissary in the treasurer’s
house of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London. Examination continued.</p>

<p>4. Whether the said will was kept in the tower called the treasury of
Sir John Fastolf at Caister till his death, and whether Paston and Howys
afterwards entered and took it, and what was then done with it? Whether,
since Fastolf’s death it was exemplified in Latin, and sealed with
Fastolf’s seal, and by whom? And whether the Latin contained more or
less than the English? Who exhibited the English will in audience of
Canterbury? Was it the true will, or was it written and sealed after
Fastolf’s death?&mdash;Soon after Fastolf’s death the said parchment was
exhibited to Paston by Howes and Worcester. It afterwards remained in
the keeping of Howes and Paston, and has since been exhibited in the
audience of Canterbury. It was not translated into Latin after Fastolf’s
death, nor sealed, to Paston’s knowledge. Does not know any will, Latin
or English, to have been sealed after Fastolf’s death.</p>

<p>5. Whether Paston exhibited any English will sealed in the audience
of Canterbury?&mdash;The note made in June contained an article relative
to Fastolf’s college, and lands in Norfolk and Suffolk granted
conditionally on their being refused by Paston. When Paston went to
London, and after a time Worcester came to him, Worcester told him this
note was put in parchment and sealed, with the other articles, by advice
of Master John Brakley, about the beginning of July. William Bukman, now
Abbot of Wymondham, then Prior of Yarmouth, was present when it was
sealed, and named as a witness. He and Thomas Ingham reported that
Fastolf told them at the time it was his will that Paston should have
those things he had granted at the time of the seisin of the said
feoffment delivered, whatever was written in the parchment. The said
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page183" id = "page183">183</a></span>
parchment (English) remains in the court. As to the Latin, Fastolf made
on paper a schedule of executors for the Latin parchment, and told
Paston and Howys that he did not mean all the executors to have
administration of his goods. He also told Paston, Bracley, and Clement
Felmyngham, after Paston returned from London, that he was informed the
Latin will gave equal powers to all the executors, which he never
intended. Fastolf made his last will in November, not altogether the
same.</p>

<p>6. Who kept Fastolf’s seal of arms and signet after his death, how
long did it remain whole, and how many writings did Paston seal with
them?&mdash;At Fastolf’s death his seal was in a purse sealed with his
signet, and placed in a chest. The signet was on his finger at death,
but was afterwards placed in the chest in presence of deponent and
Thomas Howys, Master John Bracley, Master Clement Felmyngham, and three
servants of Fastolf’s chamber, and sealed with the seals of deponent,
Howys, and others. The chest remained in Fastolf’s chamber, sometimes in
custody of his servants, and sometimes in that of Howys. Afterwards the
seals were placed in a white box sealed in the presence of divers men in
the hall of the manor, which box was delivered along with certain rings
to John Stokys, who opened the box, and after inspecting the seals and
rings, sealed it up again and delivered it to Roger Malmesbury, in whose
custody they now remain. This deponent sealed nothing with them.</p>

<p>7. Whether, after Fastolf’s death, Paston or any other wrote on a
schedule of paper a certain grant or bargain, viz., that Paston should
have Fastolf’s lands and tenements in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Norwich, for
4000 marks, and that Paston and Howys should have sole administration of
his goods so long as Paston was alive; and whether after Fastolf’s death
it was so recently written that Paston, to dry the writing, scattered
ashes over it? And if he say it was written during Fastolf’s life, by
whom was it written? By himself, or John Russe, or Friar Brakley, or
whom? And how long before Fastolf’s death, and in whose presence? And
whether that sum was specified in the schedule or a blank left for it?
And whether the contents of this schedule were extracted and put in a
new one? and by whom was that written? Whether by J.&nbsp;Russe? And
what time elapsed between the two writings? And whether the second
schedule contained more than the first, and what the additional matter
was, and by whom added? And whether this asserted will of Fastolf, made,
as Paston pretends, on Saturday, 3&nbsp;Nov. 1459, was extracted or
imagined from the contents of the said bills, or either of them? And
what was the matter in the said will added to the matters in the
schedules? And how long it was before the said pretended will could be
formed to the satisfaction of John Paston?</p>

<p>For two years before his death Fastolf had granted that Paston should
have the above lands after his death, without any condition, but for the
purpose that he should found a college at Caister of seven monks or
priests, and pay 5000 marks to be distributed for the soul of Sir John
Fastolf; and about that time he enfeoffed Paston and others in the said
lands, declaring that that enfeoffment was to the use of the said Sir
John for life, and afterwards of Paston<ins class = "correction" title =
". invisible">. </ins>After this, viz., in the said month of June,
Fastolf made the said articles in certain paper notes in Latin and
English. Master John Brakley kept copies, which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page184" id = "page184">184</a></span>
he showed to Paston after his return to London. After that, viz., in
September and October, Fastolf several times requested Paston to engross
the agreements made between them about the college, saying he would
remit to him 1000 marks of the said 5000 marks. And in October and
November he recited in certain writings that in order that he might not
be disquieted with worldly affairs he had bargained with this deponent
that he should have the control of all his lands from which any profit
might be derived in England, and of the households and foreign expenses
belonging to him, so that he should put aside as much of his dues as he
could spare for the college; and that he should have all his lands in
Norfolk, Suffolk, and Norwich, for 4000 marks, which he was to pay on
certain stated days to Fastolf’s executors for the benefit of his soul.
Two paper writings were made of the premises, one by the hand of Paston
and the other by Mr. John Brakley, which are severally remaining with
them. This agreement Brakley, by Fastolf’s order, got written out in
parchment indented, and read to Fastolf, who sealed it in his presence
as Brakley reported to Paston. Afterwards, another of the said writings
was read to Fastolf in the presence of Paston, Brakley, Mr. Clement
Felmyngham, and others, several times in October and November. Comments
were made on the reading of it by Fastolf on one occasion, when he said
a certain clause was not consistent with his intention, which was that
Paston and Howys should be sole administrators of his goods, and that as
to his lands in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Norwich, and the college to be
founded, he would dispose of them according to his agreement with
Paston,&mdash;the master to have a stipend of £10, and each of the
fellows of 10 marks, and that seven poor men should be found with 40s.
a&nbsp;year each, as stated in the will. Fastolf desired his will dated
in June to be corrected in these particulars, and written anew by Walter
Shipdam, for whom he frequently sent on this business. Meanwhile Brakley
and Paston wrote another paper in English as a memorial of Fastolf’s
intention, of which deponent delivered a copy under his own hand in
Court. The last two lines this deponent wrote and dried with ashes in
presence of Thomas Howys. The will of 14 June and that exhibited by
Paston and Howys differ little or nothing in effect, except in these
articles touching the college, and the sole administration given to
Paston and Howys.</p>

<p>As to new writings after Fastolf’s death. Brakley translated those
words about the sole administration from English into Latin, partly
before his death and partly after. After Fastolf’s death Paston, Howys,
and Brakley caused the said Walter Shipdam to put into form (<i>fecerunt
dictum W.&nbsp;S. formare</i>) the last will and testament of the said
Fastolf, both of the said college and of the said single administration
(<i>de&nbsp;dicta singulari administratione</i>), and of other things in
the will of June not contrary to his last will and declaration, of which
several writings were drawn by Shipdam, first in paper and afterwards in
parchment. As to the writing of the agreements, Brakley kept it during
Fastolf’s whole life, and a year after, and a copy remained with this
deponent after Fastolf’s death; at which time deponent and Howys were
sitting in the hall of the manor of Caister at supper when William
Worcester came into the hall, and Paston and Howys, rising from supper,
had a talk with Clement Felmyngham, John Brakley, and William Worcester,
immediately after Fastolf’s death. At
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page185" id = "page185">185</a></span>
that time, by the advice of Brakley, a&nbsp;copy of the agreement was
delivered to William Worcester, at his request, folded up and sealed
that night by Brakley, Clement Felmyngham, and Howys. It remained in
Worcester’s keeping till he rode to London, and then he left it with the
said Master John Brakley, Clement Felmyngham, and Thomas Howys. Its
tenor was transcribed on parchment by Shipdam shortly afterwards.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 90.] From the mention of ‘this cold winter’ at the
beginning of this letter we might naturally suppose that the feast ‘of
Sent Mathe,’ on or about which it was written, was that of St. Matthias,
which occurs on the 24th of February. But we believe the day of St.
Matthew to have been intended, so that the expression must have had
reference to some unusually cold weather in September. It is clear from
the contents of the letter that Margaret Paston had recently been with
her husband in London, and had just left him in company with Richard
Calle on her return towards Norfolk. Letters for her and Richard Calle
had arrived from her two sons since they departed. Now the only time, so
far as I can find, that Margaret Paston ever visited her husband in
London&mdash;at all events when her sons were grown up&mdash;was in
September 1465; and on that occasion Calle was with her, and everything
else agrees. Indeed, no one can doubt that the latter portion of the
letter immediately following was written in answer to this letter.</p>

Worsted is a small market-town in the most east part of the county of
Norfolk, formerly famous for the manufacture of those stuffs which still
bear its name, and of which, for the worship of Norfolk, J.&nbsp;Paston
desired his doublet to be made.&mdash;F.</p>

Jaquetta, daughter of Peter of Luxembourg, Earl of Saint Pol, was the
second wife of John, Duke of Bedford, the Regent of France during Henry
<span class = "smallroman">VI.</span>’s minority. She was married to him
in 1433, and after his decease, in 1435, she became the wife of Sir
Richard Wydvile, and died in 1472.</p>

Anne, eldest daughter of John Montacute, third Earl of Salisbury,
married, 1st, Sir Richard Hankford, Knight; 2ndly, Sir Lewis John,
Knight (whose will was proved in 1442); and 3rdly, John Holland, who was
created Duke of Exeter 6th January 1443, and died in 1446. Fenn
erroneously supposed the lady to have been the widow of Thomas Beaufort,
a&nbsp;previous Duke of Exeter, who died in 1426. This Beaufort, Duke of
Exeter, married Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Nevill, but
his wife did not survive him, as Fenn supposed, for at his death he was
found to have been tenant of her lands for life by the law of England.
Fenn’s note on this passage is, however, so interesting that we must
quote a part of it. Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, was buried in the Abbey of
Bury St. Edmunds. ‘On digging,’ he says, ‘amongst the ruins of this
Abbey, the body of the Duke was found, on the 20th of February 1772,
wrapt in lead, and entire. The face, hair, and every part were perfect,
and the flesh solid, but being exposed to the air, the body soon became
offensive &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
I&nbsp;procured some of the hair, which was of a fine brown colour, and
very flexible.’</p>

Sir Richard Wydvile, in 1448, was created Baron Rivers of Grafton, in
Northamptonshire, and elected a Knight of the Garter. His daughter
Elizabeth afterwards became the Queen of Edward <span class =

Earl Rivers. He was seized by the Lancaster mutineers, and beheaded at
Banbury in 1469.&mdash;F.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter
is apostyled in the handwriting of John Paston, and numbered ‘V’ at the
head. As it refers to Paston’s dispute with the Duke of Suffolk about
the manors of Hellesden and Drayton, it must belong to the year 1465.
The reader will also perceive that it contains an allusion to John
Paston’s imprisonment in the Fleet, and to my Lord Percy, who is
mentioned in Letter 609, and who must have been a fellow-prisoner of
Paston’s.</p>

that tweyn of hys men schold debat so ner hym, contrary to the Kyngs

Twysday last past at nyth; and the next day on the mornyng I rod to my

he desiyryd of us bothe that we schold neythyrthyr gadyr no felawschep,

and that on indeferent man chosyn by us bothe schold be assynyd to kepe

<p>And then I answed my Lord, and seyd how that at that tyme I had my
maistyr within the maner of Cotton, whyche was my modyr, and in to the

bryng this mater abowt, for then he wold trust to have your servyse,
alle whyche wer to hym gret tresour and avantage.</p>

<p>And this was the answer that my modyr and I gave hym, that at the

coort in contenuans, and no more to receyve of the profyts of the maner

we wold kepe it, and Syr Gylberd agreyd, so that Yelverton and Jeney
would do the same; for it was tyme for hym to sey so, for my Lord told
hym that he wold hym fast by the feet ellys, to be suyr of hym, that he

[From Fenn, iv. 62.] John Mowbray, third Duke of Norfolk, died on the
6th November 1461. It appears by the Inquisitions <i>post mortem</i>,
1&nbsp;Edward <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>, No. 46, that John,
his son and successor in the title, was seventeen years old on St.
Luke’s Day (18th October) in that year. He must therefore have been born
on the 18th October 1444, and would have been of full age on Friday,
18th October 1465. The John Paston, Esq., to whom this letter was
addressed, must have been the youngest of that name, who, as we have
seen already, had been serving in the Duke’s household. His father was
at this time a prisoner in the Fleet, so that the letter could not have
been intended for him.</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] This letter

The old word ‘dogbolt’ seems to have meant a servile follower, or one
bound to wait the commands of another. Thus in Lilly’s <i>Tragicall
Comedie of Alexander and Campaspe</i>, where Manes complains that he
serves a master whose house is a tub, Granichus remarks ‘That Diogenes
that dog should have Manes that dogbolt it grieveth nature and spiteth
art.’</p>

Fenn remarks that if we may judge from the mention of snow in this
place, the winters began earlier in those days than they do now. But
perhaps Margaret was only urging the necessity of timely action, taking
into consideration the ordinary delays of suitors. We have seen,
however, from <a href = "#letter609">Letter 609</a> that in the year

[From Fenn, iv. 240.] As to the date of this letter, we can only
reproduce what is said of it by Sir John Fenn: ‘John Wymondham, Esq.,
the writer of this letter, married Margery, the daughter of Sir Robert
Clifton, Knight, of Denver, in Norfolk, and widow of Sir Edward
Hastings, of Elsing, Knight. He therefore calls her “My Lady.” He died
in 1475.</p>

<p>‘He purchased the manor and estate at Felbrigg, of the trustees of
Sir Simon Felbrigg, where he had resided; but once in his absence Sir
John Felbrigg made a forcible entry, and dragging out his Lady by the
hair of her head, who had locked herself up in a chamber to keep
possession, got into possession, and retained it till Wymondham obtained
the King’s order to Thomas Montgomery, Esq., High Sheriff of the county,
to put him again into possession. The dispute was then settled with Sir
John Felbrigg, and upon Wymondham’s paying to him 200 marks [£133 :
6&nbsp;: 8] he released his claims, &amp;c.</p>

<p>‘This letter seems to have been written during the time that he was
dispossessed of Felbrigg, and which must have been either before the
year 1461 or 1466, those being the years in which Sir Thomas Montgomery
was Sheriff of Norfolk, and as J.&nbsp;Paston at this time seems to have
been under misfortunes, it was probably near the latter year.
I&nbsp;have therefore ventured, though doubtfully, to date the letter in
1465.’</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 242.] The date of this letter cannot be ascertained with
very great precision; but as it belongs most probably to about the same
period as <a href = "#letter619">Letter 619</a>, which we have referred

The modern version in Fenn reads ‘the Monday <i>after</i> Saint Agnes’s
Day,’ and the date subjoined at the bottom of the page is in accordance
with this reading. But it is more likely the text as printed in the old
spelling is correct. St. Agnes’ Day is the 21st January. The Monday
before it would have been the 20th in 1466.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 246.] As this letter was written after Edward <span
class = "smallroman">IV.</span>’s marriage, and before the death of John
Paston the father, the date must be either 1465 or 1466. Fenn assigns it
to the latter year, and I think he is right, though he does not state
his reasons. I&nbsp;find that John, Lord Lovel, died on the 9th January
1465, leaving his son and heir, Francis, only nine years old, so that
even if we date this letter 1466, the young lad was married at the early
age of ten. This was probably owing to his wardship having been obtained
by Lord Fitzhugh, or some person interested; but as the inquisition on
his father’s death (<i>Inq. p.&nbsp;m.</i>, 4&nbsp;Edw. <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>, No.&nbsp;27) was not taken till October 1465,
there seems no ground for believing that he could have been forced into
wedlock a month after he was left an orphan.</p>

of record, yet ther is no certificacion of recorde qwat londes they be,
nor wer [<i>where</i>] nor in qwat place they lye; but and thys clawse

of the statute above sayde, patents graunttyd of londs be fore
inquisicion were goode and effectuell and the statute is
generall:&mdash;<i>Patents dount null tytill, &amp;c. sount voydez</i>.
Thanne it folowyt well if the Acte of Parlement be no tytyll for the

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] I find no
very satisfactory evidence touching the date of this letter. Allusion is
made to John Paston having been at Lincoln. The occasion referred to
might have been in 1458, when, as we know by No.&nbsp;373, he went into the North as far as
Doncaster; or it may have been in the spring of 1461. (<i>See</i> Nos.
452 and 458.) It is not probable, however, that this letter was earlier
than the latter date, as there is no appearance at that time of any
dispute having arisen between John Paston and his brother William. On
the contrary, William Paston is in correspondence with his brother in
April 1461 (No.&nbsp;450). On the other hand,
if the occasion referred to when John Paston was at Lincoln was in the
spring of 1461, this letter could hardly have been written in the same
year; for it cannot be supposed that he left books at Caister on his
return south, when Caister was in the possession of the Duke of Norfolk.
The date, however, being so uncertain, I&nbsp;prefer to place this
letter at the end of John Paston’s correspondence rather than assign it
doubtfully to any particular year.</p>

Margaret Paston during her husband’s life. None of them, therefore, can
be later than 1466.</p>

<p>I. John Monke, a smith of the parish of St. James, Pokethorpe, in
Norwich, illiterate, of free condition, thirty-two years old and over,
alleges bribery of witnesses by Paston and Howys, who offered to sell
John Russe lands at Leystofte at little more than half their value.
Howes made Russe a present of salt, barley, and malt to the value of
£20, and promised him a full discharge of his account for goods of the
testator in his custody to the value of £200 and over. He paid Robert
Cutteler, vicar of Caster, ‘colore cujusdam ultimi <i>vale</i> dicti
testatoris prius non debite’ (<i>sic</i>), money and corn to the value
of 20 marks, and promised to present him to the living of Mawdeby
whenever Thomas Howse resigned it. They gave Felmyngham an annuity of 8
marks, and 40s. to a boy who is his servant. They gave Robert Boteler a
fee (<i>feodum</i>) of 5 marks [a&nbsp;year] for life, and the farm of a
close called Mawdeby close, besides some other gifts which are
specified. Hence the said John Russe, Rob. Cutteler, Clement Felmyngham,
and Rob. Butteler, falsely deposed in answer to the second interrogatory
that on the Saturday before the testator’s death they were present in a
certain low room (<i>bassa camera</i>) in the manor of Caister, where
the testator was principally between the hours of 8 and 11 <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span>, and that with them were the said John Paston
and John Brakley, and no others; for in reality there were present in
the chamber with the testator on that day, and especially during those
hours, the said Rob. Fitzrauf, Nich. Newman, and John Loer continually,
and the said Dan John Davye, Dan Thomas Howys, Friar John Bernard,
physician, and Henry Barbour, and several others [at intervals].
Moreover, Cutteler, Felmyngham, and Butteler, said Russe was present on
that occasion, whereas both he and Cutteler were in other places.
Moreover, bribes were given by Paston and Howes in various forms during
the months of January, February, and March 1462[-3], and at other times
in the parishes of Caister and Yarmouth, and in the city of London, to
Ralph Lampet, brother William Bukenham, and the said Rob. Cutteler.
Paston promised to promote Bukenham to the priory of Yarmouth, and also,
as a reward for his testimony, to give him 13 acres of the testator’s
land in Scroudby and Caister called Isabell, to the use of the prior and
convent of Norwich. Hence the testimony of these witnesses was false,
that Fastolf, about the beginning of Autumn five years ago, had made to
John Paston estate and feoffment and livery of seisin of his manor of
Caister, and other lands in Cos. Norf. and Suff., and the city of
Norwich, to the use of the said testator while he lived, and afterwards
to that of the said John Paston and his heirs; for if any such thing was
done (which is not admitted) it was on the 16th October 1457, in the
36th year of Henry <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span>, after the
Autumn of the said year, and not to the use of Paston and his heirs, but
to the use of Fastolf himself, and for the accomplishment of his will.
Further, the testimony of Russe, Cutteler, Bukenham, Felmyngham, and
Butteler was untrue as to the alleged will of Fastolf that John
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page238" id = "page238">238</a></span>
Paston should obtain the King’s license for the foundation of a college
at Caister. It was in truth Fastolf’s will that the executors should
obtain the King’s license to found a college there of seven Benedictine
monks of the same profession as the monastery of St. Benet at Hulme, of
whom one should be prior, and of seven poor men, and that they should be
endowed out of his lands to the extent of 300 marks a year, all charges
deducted, to pray for the soul of Lady Milicent, his wife, his parents
and benefactors; and if the executors were unable to obtain this
license, they were to give the abbot and convent of St. Benet’s lands
and money for the maintenance of six new monks and seven poor men in
that monastery with a like object. Further, it is not true as alleged
that on Saturday before his death, viz., 3rd Nov., between eight and
eleven <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span>, the testator openly
declared his will with a clear voice in the hearing of bystanders, for
he was so ill and weak from want of breath that he was unable to speak
distinctly at any time that whole day, especially during the hours above
mentioned.</p>

<p>Moreover, bribes were offered by Paston and Howes in May and June
1465, in the parishes of Caister and Yarmouth, and in the city of
London, to Thomas Thorald, Robert Lawes, Will. Waterman, John Osbern,
John Heydon, Will. Pykeryng, John Symmys, and John Shawe, for their
testimony in this matter, viz. that they should have 20s. besides
travelling expenses and divers other sums which were offered to them in
Paston’s name by Cutteler, vicar of Caister, and Ric. Calle; and John
Paston promised the said William Pykeryng that he should recover certain
lands in the tenure of his brother John Pykeryng, in Fylby, to the value
of 40s. Influenced by these bribes, Thos. Thorald deposed that on the
Saturday before Fastolf’s death, Bartholomew Elys and John Davys came to
his house in Belton, two miles and more from Yarmouth, about eight <span
class = "smallroman">A.M.</span>, when he was in his grange, and asked
him to come with them to divers manors of the said Sir John, to receive
certain grain from his farmers; after which they drank in Thorald’s
house, and he went with them to Freton, and to the manor called Calcote
hall, and other places in Lothynlond until midday. Robert Lawes also
deposed that on Friday before Fastolf’s death he went to Becclys, and
next day, viz. Saturday, returning homeward (<i>rediens domorsum</i>),
met on the way the said Bartholomew Elis, John Davy, and Thomas Thorald
going to Freton, when Davy called him and bade him tell Thomas Howys or
John Rus that on Monday or Tuesday next he would go to Caister and give
an account of his stewardship. Afterwards, about two <span class =
"smallroman">P.M.</span>, Lawes came to Caister and told John Rus his
business in the absence of Howys. But the said William Waterman, being
bribed as aforesaid, falsely declares that on the Saturday before
Fastolf’s death Barth. Elys and John Davy came to his house at Gorlyston
about seven <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span>, and that he went
with them to Thorald’s house, and that they went and spoke with Thorald
at the grange while he waited for them at the gate. Afterwards they all
entered the hall of Thomas Thorald and drank beer together, and all four
went together to Calcote-halle and waited there till ten <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span>, when Watyrman left the other three and
returned home. And about two <span class = "smallroman">P.M.</span> Elys
and Davy returned and drank beer at Watyrman’s house. But the truth is
that Elys and Davy were at Yarmouth that day from seven till past eleven
<span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span></p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page239" id = "page239">239</a></span>
<p>Further, John Osberne, Will. Pykerynge, and John Heydon were corrupt
witnesses. John Osberne said that on Saturday before the Feast of St.
Leonard, when Fastolf was ill of his last illness, the said Osberne,
Pykerynge, and Heydon came to Caister to receive certain monies of John
Rus for barley sold to him by Osberne; that about eight <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span> they entered the hall of the manor and found
Robert Hert and others, servants of Fastolf, sitting at breakfast; and
that John Russe immediately came to Osberne and talked to him about the
payment. At last Russe took them into the <i>claustrum</i>, and leaving
them, entered Fastolf’s chamber; then, after remaining two hours and
more, returned into the <i>claustrum</i> and delivered the money to
Osbern. This testimony was confirmed by Heydon and Pykeryng; but the
truth is that Russe that Saturday, from seven till near twelve o’clock
(<i>a&nbsp;principio horæ septimæ usque ad finem horæ undecimæ</i>), and
Robert Hert from seven to ten <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span>,
were at Yarmouth, three miles off.</p>

<p>Further, John Symmys and John Shawe were corrupt witnesses, the
former saying that Robert Hert was present in the said manor-house of
Caister at eight <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> on the said day,
and even at nine o’clock at dinner-time (<i>tempore prandii</i>), and
that he saw the said Robert Hert sitting among Fastolf’s other servants
at breakfast (<i>jentaculum</i>); and that he (Symmys) and Henry
Wynstall, Fastolf’s barber, were occupied together in shoeing horses in
the said manor from breakfast-time aforesaid to dinner-time, and that at
dinner-time Symmys saw the said Henry sitting in the hall with others;
and that on the said Saturday, about eight <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span>, and even at noon, Symmys saw John Rus in the
hall of the said manor. Also John Shawe deposed that on the Saturday
before Fastolf’s death he saw John Rus and Henry Wynstall in the hall of
the said manor, both at eight <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> at
breakfast and at dinner at midday, and he also saw Robert Hert, porter
at the gate of the manor, at those hours; and that between breakfast and
dinner Shawe and Wynstall were occupied along with John Symmys in
shoeing Sir John’s horses. But the truth is that both Rus and Hert were
absent as above-mentioned, and Wynstall was with Fastolf in his chamber
from nine <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> to half-past ten. Also
Symmys, William Pykeryng, Heydon, Osberne, and Lawes were all absent the
whole of that Saturday, and certainly between eight and eleven <span
class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> And notwithstanding that the contrary
is alleged against them, John Davy, Barth. Elys, John Bokkyng, John
Davy, chaplain, Thos. Upton, Nich. Newman, John Loer, Wm. Eton, Robert
Lynne, John Marshall, Wm. Lynne, Henry Wynstall, Robert Hert, and Robert
Fitzrauff, gave honest testimony in behalf of Yelverton and Worceter,
being men of good repute, sufficiently rich, and well worthy of
credit.</p>

<p>Additional exceptions on the part of Yelverton and Worcester to the
testimony of John Rus and Clement Felmyngham, showing that Paston had
offered to let to the former a tenement in Yarmouth for less than its
true value, and had promised the latter 100 marks for the Austin Friars
at South-Town,<a class = "tag" name = "tag239_1" id = "tag239_1" href =
"#note239_1">239.1</a> which was not bequeathed in Fastolf’s will; also
that he had given Master Robert Popy, besides his expenses, 20 marks for
his testimony, and remitted to him 10<i>s.</i> of the rent of a fishery
which was five years in arrear, and that he had
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page240" id = "page240">240</a></span>
also released to him 40 marks of a penalty of 100 marks due by Popy upon
a bond; in consequence of which Popy deposed that on the 30th October
three years previously,<a class = "tag" name = "tag240_1" id =
"tag240_1" href = "#note240_1">240.1</a> John Paston had reported to him
at Caister that he had made an agreement with Fastolf by which he was to
have all Fastolf’s lands in Norfolk, Suffolk, and the city of Norwich,
after his death, paying for the same 4000 marks, and was to found a
college in the manor, etc.; on hearing which Popy returned to Fastolf,
and related to him what Paston had said to him, and Sir John confirmed
it, requesting him to show the same goodwill towards Paston, as he had
done to himself. But in truth Fastolf never asserted or confirmed any
such thing.</p>

<p>Answers to interrogatories by the same deponent, viz.&mdash;1. As to
his knowledge of the parties and witnesses.</p>

<p>2. As to the alleged instances of bribery, and the absence of Rus on
the day referred to. The latter fact deponent says he knows, because he
and Rus lay together in the chamber of Thomas Howys, and on Friday
before Fastolf’s death Rus went to Yarmouth to buy victuals, and left
with him the key of the chamber, Howys being then at Blowfeld; and Rus
remained at Yarmouth all that Friday and the Saturday following, and
returned on Sunday.</p>

<p>4. As to the condition of Fastolf on the Saturday before his death.
He was so weak for want of breath that he could not speak distinctly;
those about him could not hear what he said without inclining their ears
to his mouth, and even then they could hardly understand him. And this
deponent says he knows, because on Friday and Saturday before his death
he was frequently in Sir John’s chamber, and when people spoke to him to
comfort him in his illness he only answered by sighs, so that deponent
and others could not tell what he meant. Moreover, Sir John was
accustomed when in health daily to say certain prayers with his
chaplain, but on that day the chaplain said the service alone, while
Fastolf lay on his bed and said nothing.</p>

<p>6. As to Russe and Hert being at Yarmouth, he says he heard Thomas
Howys that Saturday morning order the latter to take horse and ride
thither to get provisions for the household, and he saw him ride out of
the manor accordingly about seven <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span>, and also saw him return with the provisions
about ten <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> [In the margin here is
written ‘Nititur deponere de absencia Hert, sed non probat.’]</p>

<p>7. Knows that Henry Wynstall was absent from the hall of the manor
from about nine to half-past ten, for he saw him enter the chamber with
his instruments to shave Sir John, and wait there an hour and a half,
and he could not have left without deponent seeing him. Moreover, John
Symmys did not shoe horses in the manor that Saturday, for deponent had
the custody of the forge and kept the keys.</p>

<p>Answers to another set of interrogatories proposed on behalf of
Paston and Howes, and here quoted at length, to the following effect,
viz.: 1. Where each witness has lived since he was born, and whether he
be in the service of the party producing him? 2. As to his knowledge of
the witnesses on the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page241" id = "page241">241</a></span>
other side? 3. What particulars he can give as to any bribery he imputes
to them, and what was its special object? 4. By what means he knew it,
and by whom he has been asked to give testimony, and whether he has
conferred with his fellow-witnesses; whether they have received
instructions what to depose; how often he has come up to London to give
evidence and returned without being called; and how much he was promised
for coming? 5. Each witness is to declare how he knows the facts, and to
be charged not to reveal to the others on what subjects he was
questioned.</p>

<p>The only point of interest in these replies is that deponent was
asked by William Worcester in the city of Norwich on Sunday eight days
to give his testimony in the cause. He denies all communication with his
fellow-witnesses, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p class = "annotation">
<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The evidence of this first witness runs to five or
six times the length of any other, and we have noted all the material
points in it. Of the depositions of the others we shall not give any
summary, but mention briefly any new statements that seem to be of
interest:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "abstract">
<p>II. John Dawson, husbandman (<i>agricultor</i>), of Blowfeld, where
he has been for four years, having formerly lived five years in the
manor of Caister, and before that in Cambridge three years,
<i>literatus, liberæ conditionis</i>, about thirty years old.</p>

<p>His testimony generally agrees with that of Monke, and he says the
covenant of Akethorpe was made in the February before Fastolf’s death.
Between Christmas and Easter after his death deponent heard Howes in the
manor of Caister say to Robert Cutteler the vicar that he should have 6
marks for his labour in giving evidence about Fastolf’s will; and
afterwards Howes in his chamber in the said manor paid him 6 marks.
Paston also promised him a benefice worth 40 marks. He says, about a
month before Fastolf’s death, he heard Howes and Paston frequently
repeat publicly in the household the tenor of Sir John Fastolf’s will.
About St. John Baptist’s day last he was at Yarmouth, and heard John
Symmys and John Shawe say they were hired by Paston and Howes to give
evidence in the proving of Fastolf’s will.</p>

<p>III. John Gyrdynge of Fretenham, where he has lived four years;
before which time he lived with the Prior of St. Faith’s two years,
before that in the manor of <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: Gairdner’s usual spelling is ‘Caister’">Caster</ins>
four years, before that with John Emeryngale of Wroxham two years,
and before that in Norwich as an apprentice with Henry Toke five years;
a&nbsp;cook, illiterate and of free condition, thirty-two years old and
over.<a class = "tag" name = "tag241_1" id = "tag241_1" href =
"#note241_1">241.1</a> Agrees with the evidence of corruption against
Rus and others. Was present in Fastolf’s room that Saturday forenoon,
and saw the two chaplains celebrating mass. H.&nbsp;Wynstall the barber
was present till ten <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span></p>

<p>IV. William Boswell of Thetford, who was four years with Friar
Bracley, &amp;c., <i>literatus</i>, of free condition, thirty years old
and more. Heard Howys, Paston, and Rus frequently confer at Caister
about the sale of a house in Yarmouth,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page242" id = "page242">242</a></span>
which Howys, at the request of Paston, at length granted to Rus at £20
less than its value, to the end that Rus might bear witness in their
favour and in the proving of Fastolf’s will. [Here occurs a marginal
note by another hand, ‘Male sonat. Quod alius consensit non probatur.’
At the head of this deposition also it is said that this witness has
been proved corrupt.]</p>

<p>V. Robert Inglys of Lodon, gentleman, who has lived there two years,
and before that in the parish of Hopton three years, before that with
Henry None, Esq., for more than a year, before that with Sir John
Fastolf two years, before that with the Abbot of Langley two years, and
before that in Hopton with his father; illiterate, and of free
condition, thirty years old and more.</p>

<p>VI. Richard Horne of Brundall, Norwich diocese, husbandman
(<i>agricultor</i>), who has lived there four years, and before that
with Thomas Howys six years, and before that in the parish of St.
George, Southwark, three years; illiterate, of free condition,
twenty-six years old.</p>

<p>VII. Thomas Pykeryng of Wroxham, Norwich diocese, who has been a
schoolmaster at Norwich and Aylesham, and is now clerk to Robert
Norwich, steward of the Abbot of St. Benet’s, Hulme.</p>

<p>VIII. Henry Clerke of Blowfeld, husbandman (<i>agricultor</i>), once
in the service of Sir John Fastolf, illiterate, twenty-eight years old,
of free condition. Says that on the Saturday before Fastolf’s death
Howys sent him and John Shawe to Yarmouth about seven <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span>, with a cart-load of malt to one named Chirche;
that they arrived about eight, and were spoken to by John Rus and Robert
Cutteler in the market-place; that they waited with their cart till two
<span class = "smallroman">P.M.</span>, when deponent took leave of Russ
and Cutteler in the street, having repeatedly seen them there in the
interval. Also that at eight and nine <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span> he saw Robert Hert in Yarmouth, who soon after
his arrival delivered him a sack containing meat, bought, as he said, by
Rus for Fastolf’s household. He says also that between eight and nine he
spoke with the said John Symmys, William Pykeryng, and John Osbern in
Yarmouth.</p>

<p>Marginal notes are appended to the above statements, affirming that
bribery had been proved against this witness by four others, and that he
stood alone in his testimony.</p>

<p>IX. John Tovy of Caister, where he has lived ever since he was born,
<i>agricultor, literatus</i>, of free condition, twenty-four years old
and more; cannot depose of his own knowledge to the bribery of John Rus
and the others. He says John Rus was not present in the manor on the
said Saturday, having to be at Yarmouth to provide victuals for the
household. About eight <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span> witness
conveyed to the said manor some linen, which his mother had washed, for
she was Sir John’s washerwoman, and waited there, sometimes in the hall
and sometimes in Sir John’s chamber, till after midday, but did not see
John Rus or any of the others named, as he would have done if they had
been present.</p>

<p>X. Thomas Hert of Caister, <i>agricultor</i>, who has lived there
from his birth, illiterate, of free condition, twenty-three years old.
Cannot depose to bribery except from hearsay. Was sent to Caister by his
father on the Saturday before Fastolf’s death with capons to be sold to
John Rus, purveyor of victuals for the household, but on inquiring for
him, found he was absent, and delivered the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page243" id = "page243">243</a></span>
capons to Sir Thomas Howes. Waited till nine <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span> and saw neither Rus, Cutteler, Boteler, nor
Robert Hert, but was told Rus was at Yarmouth, and Boteler sick in his
chamber. John Symmys had nothing to do with the shoeing of Sir John’s
horses that day. Was asked to bear witness in this cause a fortnight ago
by Sir William Yelverton’s servant at Caister.</p>

<p>XI. William Shave, roper of Yarmouth, illiterate, of free condition,
fifty-eight years old. On the Saturday before Fastolf’s death, was at
the house of John Balle, at the sign of the Cock, in Yarmouth, in a
parlour near the public street, when Sir Thomas Howes informed John Rus,
there present, that he had been desired by John Paston to remit to him
£20 of the price of a house sold to Rus by the said Thomas, and
thereupon he remitted to him the said £20 and 5 marks, in which he was
bound to Sir John Fastolf. He also promised him the lands of Akethorp
Hall for 40 marks less than any other, provided he would favour the
intention of Howes and Paston. [It is remarked in the margin that
witness does not say what intention.] William Lynde, a&nbsp;servant of
Sir John Fastolf, was present, besides others. He saw Russ and Cutteler
that Saturday at Yarmouth, between nine and twelve <span class =
"smallroman">A.M.</span>, and spoke with them and drank in the house of
Thomas Lounde. As to Thomas Torald, witness was at Yarmouth one
Saturday, when he heard Robert Cutteler and Torald conversing; and the
former told the latter that Sir Thomas Howes loved him well, and that
John Paston could do him much good, and in the name of Paston and Howes
he promised Torald 20<i>s.</i> for his labour, besides expenses, if he
would depose for them. Knows that on the Saturday before Fastolf’s death
Bartholomew Elys was in Yarmouth from half-past eight to eleven <span
class = "smallroman">A.M.</span>, for he and witness bought fish called
roches together, sold some, and divided others in Elys’s house. That day
he saw John Rus in Yarmouth several times every hour from seven to
eleven <span class = "smallroman">A.M.</span>, for he was in the
market-place all that time on his business, and at vespers he saw John
Rus in the parish church of the said town. Next day, Sunday, he also saw
him there at matins and at mass.</p>

<p>XII. Nicholas Chirche of Yarmouth, merchant, <i>literatus</i>, of
free condition, forty years old and more. Testifies concerning a
conversation held in John Balle’s parlour at the Cock in Yarmouth after
the Christmas following Fastolf’s death, with Sir Thomas Howes, John
Paston, John Rus, Friar Clement Felmyngham, Dan Robert Cutteler, Robert
Boteler, Thomas Neve, and others, when Howes remitted to John Rus £20 of
the price of a house he had sold him, and 5 marks of the arrears of his
accounts. He also testifies to other acts of the same nature on that
occasion, and to the absence of Rus and Cutteler at Yarmouth on the
Saturday above referred to, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[In the margin it is remarked that this witness has been proved
corrupt by three others.]</p>

<p>On the 22d May John Naseby, proctor for Yelverton and Howes, produced
as a witness one John Rugge, in presence of Master Robert Kent, Paston’s
proctor.</p>

<p>XIII. Thomas Newton of Burgh, <i>agricultor</i>, illiterate, of free
condition, fifty years old and more.</p>

<p>XIV. Thomas Spycer of Southtown, by Yarmouth, tailor, illiterate, of
free condition, fifty years old and more.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page244" id = "page244">244</a></span>
<p>XV. Thomas Neve of Jernemuth [<i>Yarmouth</i>], merchant,
<i>literatus</i>, of free condition, forty years old and more.</p>

<p>XVI. John Rugge, mariner, of Yarmouth, illiterate, of free condition,
fifty years old.</p>

<p>XVII. John Clerke of Gorlaston, <i>agricultor</i>, illiterate, of
free condition, fifty years old. Heard Clement Felmyngham report to him
at the Austin Friars in Southtown that Paston and Howes had given him a
pension of 8 marks a year for life, and 40<i>s.</i> for his servant, to
say masses for the soul of Sir John Fastolf. Cannot witness of bribery
otherwise. A&nbsp;little after Michaelmas, two years before Fastolf’s
death, William Worceter in Fastolf’s name delivered possession of six of
his manors in Lodylond, viz. Spytlyng in Gorlaston, Bradwell Hall in
Bradwell, Hadlounde in Bradwell, Calcotes in Freton, Beytons in Belton,
and Akethorpe in Leystoft, to Sir Thomas Howes and others, his
co-feoffees named in a charter of enfeoffment, to the use of Sir John
during his life, and to execute his will afterwards. This he knows,
because he rode with Howes to the said manors when he took possession,
and saw and heard Worceter deliver possession thereof. Thomas Torald
reported to witness in Lent last that Paston and Howes had promised and
paid him 20<i>s.</i>, besides his expenses, to give evidence in the
proving of Fastolf’s will, and had given each of his fellow-witnesses as
much.</p>

<p>XVIII. Robert Bunche of Yarmouth, mariner, <i>literatus</i>, of free
condition, fifty years old. Swears to having seen John Rus that Saturday
at Yarmouth between seven and eight. [A&nbsp;marginal note says that
being afterwards produced as a witness by Paston, he admitted having
been suborned, and having deposed falsely.]</p>

<p>On the 22d July Yelverton’s proctor, Naseby, produced in presence of
Paston’s proctor, Kent, two witnesses, viz.&mdash;Stephen Scrope, Esq.,
and Richard Fastolf.</p>

<p>XIX. Stephen Scrope, Esq., of free condition, seventy years old or
about. Says he was several times with Sir John Fastolf in his manor of
Caister within the two years before his death, when Sir John told him he
had made his will, and had ordered his executors to erect a college of
six or seven monks and seven poor men at Caister, and that they should
have lands and goods to the value of 300 marks a year, if a license
could be obtained from the King to that effect; otherwise that the
number of monks at St. Benet’s should be increased, and seven poor men
supported in the monastery. [In the margin it is remarked that this
witness proves nothing against the accused witnesses, but only
endeavours to depose concerning the will of the deceased.]</p>

<p>XX. Richard Fastolfe, of the parish of St. Mary Eldermary, in London,
tailor, where he has lived for two years, and before that in the parish
of St. Michael, Crokydlane, London, for a quarter of a year, formerly
with the Duke of York, <i>literatus</i>, of free condition, thirty-two
years old. Went to Caister about the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy
Cross preceding Fastolf’s death, along with one Thomas Plummer,
<i>scriptor</i>, of London, now deceased. Found Sir John walking about
his chamber led by two servants, when Plummer petitioned him to help
deponent with goods that he might marry, as he was one of Sir John’s
relations. To this Sir John made answer that he had within a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page245" id = "page245">245</a></span>
few [days] preceding made his will, which he would not alter, and that
he had made mention of deponent therein. He also said to Plummer that if
he had come in good time, he should have written his will.</p>

from Kinge Edward the Fourth to restore Sir John Paston to the lands and

‘To all tenaunts, fermors, or occupiers of all the lands and tenements,

deceased, by way of inheritance, or Agnes Paston, Margaret Paston,
William Paston, and Clement Paston, or any of them, and to all such

thenceforth to pay the whole issues and profits thereof to Sir John

<p>Was at Snaylwell on Sunday, but could get no money. Most of the
tenants away at Canterbury or elsewhere. The rest said when you were
there last you had given them till Candlemas, ‘so that thei myght malt
ther corn and brynge it to the best preffe.’ Warned them to be ready by
Tuesday before St. Edmond the King, when Richard Calle would visit them.
A&nbsp;thrifty man beside Bery is willing to take the farm; but every
one says the last farmer was undone by it. Advises Paston not to
overcharge his farms. I&nbsp;have seen Catelyn’s corn, and your tenants
say it is sufficient to content you. Your shepherd wishes to know if you
will continue him, for no one has spoken to him since my master your
father died. Men of Fordham have occupied your ground these two years
that my master has been in trouble. I&nbsp;think you should speak to my
Lord of Worcester, as he and Woodhous are lords of the town. I&nbsp;have
bid the farmers at Snaylwell sow some wheat land, and have warned the
tenants at Sporle, Pagrave, and Cressingham to be ready to pay. Advises
him to keep up his place at Langham’s. If ‘my master’ had lived he would
have exchanged it for the parsonage. Supped on Monday night at a place
of the Duke of Suffolk’s with the parson of Causton, a&nbsp;chaplain of
the Duchess, ‘and they talked sore of my Lady’s bargain, and were right
sorry that she should forsake it.’ The parson asserted that the feoffees
had put her in possession of the manors. Talk over this with your
counsel; for if the feoffees be compelled to release in Chancery it will
be nought, because of the estate they made before; so when you expect to
be most quiet you will be most troubled. There was also the parson of
Brampston, and he said W.&nbsp;Yelverton had sent a letter to the
bailiff he has set at Guton, but what it meant I could not find out.
W.&nbsp;Yelverton has put the parson of Heynford out of his farm.
I&nbsp;did not speak with your mother before writing this, as she was at
Caister.</p>

<p>Desires his favour for Frere John Chesteyn and John Russe of
Yarmouth, who are suspected by Lord Scales of having treasures or jewels
of my Master Paston’s. He never trusted them with any, knowing they were
familiar with William Jenney and Sir Thomas Howes. Is sure he put no
treasure into any place in that town, religious or other, for he often
said he wondered any thrifty man would live in it, ‘there were so much
riotous people therein.’ Begs his favour for my mistress Paston, ‘which
is now under your governance.’ Hopes to see her hereafter ‘as worshipful

[From Fenn, iv. 172.] The precise date of this letter is by no means
certain. Fenn dates it merely between 1463 and 1469; but if it be ‘my
Lady of Oxford,’ and not ‘my Lord,’ who is spoken of near the end
(<i>see</i> page 268, footnote&nbsp;2), it may be many years later. The
Earl of Oxford was committed to the Tower in the latter part of the year
1468. In 1470 he took part in the brief restoration of Henry <span class
= "smallroman">VI.</span>, and on the return of Edward <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span> he was obliged to quit the country. If the Earl,
therefore, is alluded to as living in England, the date cannot well be
later than 1468. Probably it is about the year 1467. In that year the
29th January fell on a Thursday, which would allow a reasonable time for
the writer to suggest to Sir John Paston the expediency of his being in
London on Monday or Tuesday following.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 276.] This letter must have been written in February
1467. It was evidently after Sir John Paston had succeeded to his
father’s estates, but before any arrangement had been come to between
him and Yelverton. It will be found hereafter that on the 11th January
1468 Sir John Fastolf’s executors, including Yelverton, released their
rights in Caister and other manors to Sir John Paston. On the back of
this letter, Fenn says, is written in an ancient hand, ‘Testes idonei ad
negandum veritatem, ut patet infra.’</p>

[From Paston <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, B.M.] As this
letter has reference to the disputes between the Duke of Suffolk and the
Paston family about Drayton, it might be supposed to have been written
about the year 1464, but that the entire absence of any mention of John
Paston the father makes it probable that the true date is after his
death. It is therefore not unlikely to be of the same year as <a href =
"#letter671">No. 671</a>, in which Margaret Paston mentions the
probability of Hellesdon being taken again out of their hands, and also
desires an answer to a letter that she had sent to her son, Sir John,

As it appears by the postscript that this letter was hurriedly
despatched, we may perhaps presume that it was intended in the first
instance for Sir John Paston, but that as ‘my cousin Damme’ required to
be informed of the same particulars, it was afterwards addressed to him,
with instructions to communicate the contents to Sir John.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 294.] This letter must have been written some time after
Sir John Paston had obtained possession of Caister by virtue of the
King’s warrant of the 17th July 1466 (<a href =
"#letter641">No.&nbsp;641</a>), and before the Duke of Norfolk laid
claim to it again in 1469. Thus the date is certainly either 1467 or
1468. But in the latter year Sir John Paston and his brother were both
in Flanders at the marriage of the Princess Margaret to the Duke of
Burgundy; and Daubeney could not have been with them, as he was when
this letter was written, for John Paston the younger says he had sent
him five shillings by Calle’s man. Thus 1467 appears to be the only year
possible.</p>

[Add. <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 34,889, f. 196.] The date of
this letter is difficult to fix, but from the two brothers being
together (which was rather a rare occurrence), and both in good health,
the summer of 1467 seems not improbable. (<i>See</i> <a href =
"#letter671">No. 671</a>.) The date must at least be earlier than Nov.
1469, when Sir John Paston, as we shall hereafter find, actually
executed an indenture for the sale of East Beckham. It seems quite
impossible, moreover, that this letter can be of the year 1469.</p>

<p class = "sidenote">1467 or later</p>

<p class = "abstract">
Requests ‘her Highness’ to confirm some grants of her late husband to
him of land at Basyngham. William Swan claims, and has taken from him 2
perches of ground in breadth near his (Swan’s) gate, which has always
been parcel of Herlyng’s tenement of Greyve’s during his and his
father’s time. John Pykerell, too, has made mean to the Abbot of St.
Benet’s to remove a boundary stone which has stood there sixty years.
Pykerell also took the writer’s horse and used it in his field without
leave, on Friday before the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, 6&nbsp;Edw.
<span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>, which made the beast
unserviceable till Fastegong next following. Pykerell has also done him
other injuries.</p>

<p class = "annotation">
[As this petition refers to the ‘Fastegong’ or Shrovetide after
Holy-Rood Day 6 Edw. <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span> as a past
date, it cannot have been drawn up earlier than the year 1467. The manor
of Basingham, in Norfolk, belonged to the Mauteby family, and came to
John Paston by marriage. This paper, therefore, was addressed to his
widow Margaret.]</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 280.] It seems probable that this letter was written
about the beginning of the year 1468. As to the time of year, we may
judge by one expression that it was not very long after Christmas; and
as the writer congratulates Margaret Paston that Caister is to be at her
command, we may with great probability suppose the date to be about the
same as that of the preceding document.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 290.] This letter was written on the Tuesday before
Easter, probably in the year 1468, <i>i.e.</i> after the other executors
of Fastolf had released to Sir John Paston. The date could hardly be
later than 1469, when Sir John was driven out of Caister by the Duke of
Norfolk; and in 1469 he does not seem to have been residing there about
Easter.</p>

[From Fenn, ii. 26.] The writer of this letter was committed to the
Tower in November 1468, and though afterwards released, it was not long
before he became a declared enemy of Edward <span class =

<span class = "smallroman">VI.</span> in 1470, he was obliged to leave
the kingdom. The date of this letter, therefore, is not likely to be
later than the present year, but it may be a year or two earlier.</p>

[From Fenn, ii. 294.] The Mrs. Anne to whom this letter was addressed
seems to have been a Mrs. Anne Haute, to whom Sir John was for a long
time engaged. That it was written before the year 1469 will appear
probable on referring to Margaret Paston’s letter written on Easter
Monday (3rd April) in that year, in which she wishes to know for certain
if he be engaged; and we have therefore little difficulty in referring
it to the year 1468, when Sir John was over in Flanders at the marriage
of the Princess Margaret to Charles of Burgundy. Mrs. Anne appears to
have been a lady of English extraction, who was either born abroad or
had passed most of her life on the Continent. She was, moreover, related
to Lord Scales, and is therefore not unlikely to have been the daughter
of one William Haute of Kent, who married at Calais, in 1429, the
daughter of a certain Richard Wydeville. (See <i>Excerpta Historica</i>,
p. 249.) But she could speak and even read English; and Sir John, who
was now returning homewards to England, designed in this letter to open
a correspondence with her. He appears, however, not to have despatched
it, as the original remained among the papers of the Paston family; or
else perhaps it was returned to him on the breaking off of the
engagement.</p>

Thomas Howes, ‘for the discharge of his conscience,’ impugning the

written upon a whole sheet of paper, of which a quarter was cut away
before the letter was finished, so that the bottom part of it was only
half the width of the upper. Roger Ree was made Sheriff of Norfolk in
1468, which fixes the date.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 266.] Elizabeth Paston, as we have seen (No.&nbsp;374),
had married Robert Poynings by the
beginning of January 1459. We must, however, correct a slight inaccuracy
in the preliminary note to that letter, where it is said that by the
year 1470 they must have been married several years. Their union, in
fact, lasted little more than two years; for Robert Poynings was slain
at the second battle of St. Albans on the 17th February 1461. The
inquisition <i>post mortem</i>, taken some years afterwards (9&nbsp;and
10 Edw. <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>, No.&nbsp;49), gives that
day as the date of his death. His son and heir, Edward, named in this
letter (who was afterwards Lord-Deputy of Ireland in the reign of Henry
<span class = "smallroman">VII.</span>), was probably born towards the
close of the year 1459, for he is mentioned at the date of the
inquisition (31st Jan. 49 and 1 Hen. <span class =
"smallroman">VI.</span>, <i>i.e.</i> 1471) as eleven years old and over.
Elizabeth Poynings must have remained a widow some years; but before
1472 she had married Sir George Browne of Betchworth, Surrey. This
letter is certainly of later date than <a href = "#letter627">No.
627</a>, for the lands which she was then endeavouring to recover from
the Earl of Kent were now occupied by the Earl of Essex. It may perhaps
have been a year or two after 1466, but it was probably not later than
1469, as in 1470 Henry <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span> was
restored, and Essex, being a Yorkist, would not have been so powerful.
The year 1468 must be a tolerable approximation to the true date.</p>

[From Fenn, iv. 100.] The writer of this brief and enigmatical letter
was the second husband of Elizabeth Paston, as mentioned in the
preliminary note to <a href = "#letter692">No. 692</a> preceding. If the
John Paston, Esquire, to whom it is addressed be the first of that name,
that is to say, Elizabeth Paston’s brother, the date is not later than
1466; but as it was certainly some years later before the writer became
connected with the Pastons by marriage, the person addressed is more
probably John Paston the youngest, brother of Sir John. The date of this
communication, however, is unimportant. Its purport, of which Fenn has
suggested rather a complicated explanation, appears to me simply a
promise of secrecy on some subject: ‘<i>Loyauté, aimé</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
Honour bright, my dear friend). It shall never come out for me.’</p>
